**AdsorpLab** is a powerful and user-friendly web application designed to analyze and compare adsorption isotherm models using experimental data. Developed with Python and Streamlit, the app allows researchers, scientists, and engineers to fit their data to multiple adsorption models, evaluate statistical performance, and visualize results in an interactive interface.

## ðŸŒ¿ Key Features

- Upload your experimental adsorption data (Ce vs. qe).
- Fit and compare 10 well-known isotherm models:
  - Langmuir
  - Freundlich
  - Temkin
  - Jovanovich
  - Dubinin-Radushkevich
  - Sips
  - Toth
  - Khan
  - Redlichâ€“Peterson
  - Agossou (2-parameter model)
- Automatic calculation of model parameters.
- Statistical evaluation: RÂ², AIC, BIC.
- Interactive plots and adjustable model views.
- Interpretive section explaining the assumptions and implications of each model.
- Langmuir RL value and its interpretation included.

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use

1. Launch the application (locally or online).
2. Upload your CSV file containing equilibrium concentrations (Ce) and adsorbed quantities (qe).
3. Select the models you wish to apply.
4. View the fitted curves, statistical results, and model interpretations.

## ðŸ“ˆ Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Plotly

## ðŸš€ Deploying the App

You can deploy this app using [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or any Python-compatible hosting environment.
